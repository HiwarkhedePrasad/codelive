              CodeLive is a real-time collaborative coding platform that enables
              developers to code together, no matter where they are in the
              world. Built with modern web technologies, CodeLive provides a
              seamless environment for pair programming, teaching, and
              collaborative problem-solving.

              Our mission is to make collaborative coding accessible and

          <div className="mb-10">
            <p className="mb-4">
              CodeLive began as a passion project to solve a common problem in
              remote software development: the need for seamless real-time
              collaboration. Traditional code sharing methods often resulted in
              delays, confusion, and inefficiency.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We envisioned a platform where developers could not only share
              code but also see each other's edits in real-time, communicate
              effectively, and execute code together â€“ all in one integrated
              environment.
